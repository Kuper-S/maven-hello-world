# Build and Publish Java Application Pipeline with GitHub Actions and DockerHub




# Descreption 
This repository contains the source code of simple Java application,along with a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the process of building, testing, packaging, and Publish  this application image.
This is an overview of this CI/CD pipeline, including the technologies used, GitHub secrets configuration , and a breakdown of each step in the pipeline.


# Quick Start
 **Trigger the workflow**: Push a change to the `master` branch or manually trigger the workflow through GitHub's UI under the "Actions" tab.


# Prerequisites
- A Docker Hub account + Generete Accesss tokens anad add them.
- Git installed on your local machine.


# Technologies Used 
Java: We use Java 1.8 for compling the application.
Maven: For build and dependency management tool for this Project and Maven Plugins.
Docker: For containerizing the application, ensuring consistent environments across the runners and for images creations .
GitHub Actions: Automates CI/CD pipeline, from code push to Publish the final image Version.
Bash: For automated process like versioning and other configuration



# Secrets Configuration
Set your own GitHub secrets to securely handle sensitive data with GitHub Actions workflow:
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME: Enter Your Docker Hub username, used for pushing images.
DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD: Enter Docker Hub password, used for Docker login.
    OR
DOCKERHUB_TOKEN: Enter Docker Hub Token for more secure connections.
GIT_USER: Your git username for committing version bumps.
EMAIL: Your email associated with the git user for commit operations.

# Workflow Overview

Workflow File Location: .github/workflows/build_and_deploy.yml
Trigger: The pipeline is triggered on every push to the master branch , you can change your trigger if needed.

# Workflow Pipline Steps Explained 
Environment: The job runs on the latest Ubuntu runner (ubuntu-latest) provided by GitHub Actions. This ensures that we got a consistent and up-to-date environment for this pipeline execution.

Steps:
        *Clone Stage: Clones the repository code onto the runner.
        *Compile Java Source Code Stage: Compiles the application source code.
        *Tests Stage: Executes unit tests to ensure code reliability.
        *Package Artifact Stage: Packages compiled code into a JAR file.
        *Increment Patch Version Stage: Automatically increments the application's patch version by using bash script.
        *Commit and Push Version Stage: Commits the version increment back to the repository to make sure the remote repo is aligned with the latest pom version.
        *Build Docker Image Stage: Builds a Docker image of the application with 2 tags , latest and the version we working on.
        *Login to Docker Hub Stage: Authenticates with Docker Hub to enable image pushing.
        *Push Docker Image Stage: Pushes the built image to Docker Hub twice latest + version number.
        *Pull Docker Image Stage: Pulls the image for testing.
        *Run Docker Container for Testing Stage: Tests the running container to ensure the app is running on the continer.



# So have FUN and Pipline as much as you can =)
